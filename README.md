# Subdomain Scanner[BETA]
A subdomain scanner that combines subdomain scanning tools!

# Description
A subdomain scanner that combines **several subdomain scanning tools**!
I've also added **httprobe** and **eyewitness** to scan live subdomains and screenshot them!
This makes it easier so you only need to run this script once! More tools and helpful functions comming soon! 

# Installation
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/flemishhacker/Subdomain-Scanner.git`

2. `$ cd Subdomain-Scanner/`

3. `$ sudo chmod +x enum.sh`

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE *SUBLIST3R* and *HTTPROBE* INSTALLED TO AVOID ANY CRASHES!**

**PLEASE CHANGE THE LOCATION OF THE TOOLS MENTIOND ABOVE TO THE DOWNLOAD LOCATION!**

# Usage

`$ ./enum.sh example.com output.txt`

# BETA
**This tool is still not complete! More subdomain scanners and other helpful functions are going to be added later on!** 

**Please report bugs/crashes! I can't fix bugs that I don't know about! Thank you!**
